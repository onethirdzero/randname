# randname

Random name generator written in Go for practice. Inspired by [phobologic's version](https://github.com/phobologic/random_name/) and the [Docker implementation](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go).

## Installation

```go
go get github.com/onethirdzero/randname
```

## Wishlist

- [ ] Make this a cli app
- [ ] Pull words from a public API
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Make camel case an option?
